## The Storm 


The storm passed through, yet I stayed still, <br>
The echoes fading down the hill. <br>
The sky kept weeping, I heard the screams, <br>
Yet she remained, a distant dream. <br>
No fleeting glance, no solace, <br>
Just empty winds that brush my face. <br>
My hollow eyes, they plead in vain, <br>
For one lost glimpse through sheets of rain. <br>
Now silence speaks where voices fade, <br>
As love decays in twilight's shade.
