## *Last Cry!!*

Without you, no place is home, <br>
My aching heart forever roams. <br>
The melancholy, always stays, <br>
As I stand here, lost in haze. <br>
 <br>
These sleepless eyes, they search the skies, <br>
Throughout the night, this soul just cries. <br>
One fragile breath might slip away, <br>
If love is left to drift astray. <br>
 <br>
If you should turn your face aside, <br>
This body breaks, this soul would hide. <br>
But if your eyes meet mine each day, <br>
I'll trade my life and, forever stay. <br>
 <br>
Your single smile can calm my storm, <br>
Your voice alone can keep me warm. <br>
Each word you speak, feels like grace, <br>
That weaves the light back on my face. <br>
 <br>
I walk through shadows just to find, <br>
The quiet corner of your mind. <br>
And though the world may fade to grey, <br>
You color every breath I take. <br>
 <br>
To soothe my frown, no distant shore, <br>
Could give me what I’m longing for. <br>
Just one more touch, one whispered name, <br>
A spark inside, will make me sane. <br>
 <br>
So hold me close and let me fall, <br>
Into your arms that binds it all. <br>
For love like this won’t fade away, <br>
I'll love you till the end of my days.
